# Polesia-Landcover

We use Google Earth Engine to carry out annual automated mapping of landcover in Polesia. This is achieved with an optimised Random Forest algorithm that is applied over a set of ‘complex’ and ‘simple’ classes that draw their classification characteristics from a customised annualised satellite data stack. The complex classes split out forest types and swamps into a finer degree as possible. The simple classes bin these finer ecological gradations into coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and swamps. We use a mixture of Sentinel 1 and 2 bands, some of which are turned into indices in order to reduce dimensionality.
